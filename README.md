## Step 3: Install dependencies needed for the application

Put this command in your terminal in your code editor:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
This will automatically install the needed dependencies and libraries needed to run the project. Wait for all the installations to finish before proceeding to Step 4.

## Step 4: Run the web scraper engine (backend)

Run this command in your terminal to run the web scraper engine:
```
python scraper.py
```
Or run this command for some versions of python:
```
python3 scraper.py
```

## Step 5: Run the interactive UI webpage (frontend)
Run these commands to start the Next.js application where you can start using the application:

1. Navigte to scraper-app folder (where all Next.js files are stored):
```
cd scraper-app
```
2. Once you are in /scraper-app directory, run Next.js application in developmental mode:
```
npm run dev
```
The app should be running now. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to start using the app.

You should see the application like this:
/// PIC

There should be dropdown options for each field. Please select the option that fit your need. 

For MatchID, please put in the course number you need to search for. For example: **COSC 1336**
- Subject: ```COSC```
- MatchID: ```1336```
  
Examples of how to fill out the form:
1) /// PIC 2
